A fun computer vision project where I built my own invisibility cloak using Python and OpenCV. It detects a specific color (pink) in real time and replaces it with the background, creating a smooth invisibility effect.
Whatâ€™s Inside
->Real-time color detection and masking
->Background replacement using OpenCV
->Implemented using HSV color space and image processing techniques
